# Safe Inheritance module
The inheritance module allows a Safe to set new owners (heirs) with a time delay. The time delayed heirs can be used for inheritance or as a back-up wallet.

## Description
Periodically the owner needs to update the deadline, else the heirs are able to become owners of the safe.
