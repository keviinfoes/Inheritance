# Safe Inheritance module
The inheritance module allows a Safe to set spenders with a time delay. The time delayed spenders can be used for inheritance or as a back-up wallet.

## Description
- Periodically the owner needs to update the deadline, else the spender is able to spend the balance of the Safe.
